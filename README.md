***

<p align="center">Gunmetal is designed to keep the usage of many colors to a minimum, and make only the most important syntax elements stand out, resulting in a very pleasant and distraction free place to code. If this isn't colorful enough, check out it's predecessor [Mountaineer](https://github.com/co1ncidence/mountaineer).</p>

<h3 align="center">Installation</h1>

<p align="center">Easy, simply place the `gunmetal.vim` file inside your vim colors folder, which should be either `~/.vim/colors/` or `~/.config/nvim/colors`, and then set `colorscheme mountaineer` in your vim config file. There are no options to this colorscheme, it works great out of the box.</p>
